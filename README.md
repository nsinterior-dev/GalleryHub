#Gallery Hub

Gallery hub application to perform carousel and view photos

## Getting Started

SET UP TO TRY THIS:

1. Clone this project, then insert the link to the version control of your IDE.
2. Inside your IDE, type the command, 'flutter pub get' in order to check if the dependencies are still working.
3. Set up your device or the emulator of your IDE.
4. Run the app.

INSIDE THE APP:
1. Simple Log-in functionality
2. Once logged in, the hub is displayed with Carousel and two tab views
3. Click a photo to see it up close!


PS: I used Unsplash API to display the images.


That's all! Thank you!
